            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, my name's Dalton, but I'm also known as TheLocalAdmin. I enjoy playing a variety of games, including PokÃ©mon, Minecraft, GTA, Rocket League, and many others. I'm passionate about helping people, leadership, and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests also extend to cybersecurity, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), and Google dorking. Outside of tech, I enjoy hanging out with friends and just enjoying life.
            </p>
            
            <h3>My Username</h3>
            <p class="origin-story">
                The origin story behind my username comes from when I used to use the Horion hack client to act as a "local admin" on Minecraft Realms. Back when clients were very powerful, I would essentially perform admin tasks without having official permissions, which was a lot of fun. I thought it would be funny to buy this domain for 10 years! Anyway, have a good one.
